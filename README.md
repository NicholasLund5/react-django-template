# React-Django Template

This repository is a template for setting up a project using React and Django. It provides a basic framework including an API directory for the Django backend and a frontend directory for the React application.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main directories:

- `api/`: Contains the Django application with models, views, serializers, and other backend functionalities.
- `frontend/`: Houses the React application, including the source files, static assets, and templates.
